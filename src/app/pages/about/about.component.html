  <h1>About</h1>

  <img class="avatar" src="/images/profile.jpg" alt="Photo of Chris Newell" />

  <p>
    I’m a U.S. veteran and I’m transitioning into web development.
    I enjoy building practical tools, learning modern frameworks, and shipping clean, simple UI.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of development, I’m into training, the outdoors, and living in places that support a simple lifestyle.
