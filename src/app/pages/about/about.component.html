  <p>
  I am a web development student currently completing a Bachelor of Science in Web Development at Bellevue University, with an expected graduation in Summer 2026. My academic focus includes front-end development, modern JavaScript frameworks, responsive design, and application deployment.
</p>

<p>
  I am particularly interested in building clean, user-friendly web experiences that balance thoughtful design with practical implementation. Through my coursework, I have worked with technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Angular, and I enjoy translating requirements into intuitive, functional interfaces.
